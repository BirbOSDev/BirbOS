# BirbOS (DISCONTINUED)
A basic Batch OS developed by Dukemz, xandrei and Ad2017.
Current version: 8.3-1

First setup:
Run birbtool first to create a user. (note that birbos does have a guest account but it's very limited)
After you created a user with birbTool, enjoy birbOS!

*Please note that this is not an actual OS and it's just a fun batch program.*
